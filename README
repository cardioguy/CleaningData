Run_analysis.R  contains the main routine run_analysis and function read_dataset. 

Run_analysis

Sets the working directory (using the full path) and loads the data.table library (available from CRAN).  
The filenames are passed as strings to avoid making a-priori assumptions about filenames and directory structure thus allowing greater flexibility.  
In this case the strings for the subdirectory name, and filenames for the raw data, label data and subject information are provided as string for both the test and training data.  
The feature names, and activity labels are read and the only those features with the text mean or std are selected.  
This subset of features is passed to the read_dataset , along with the string of filesnames and labels which reads and “assembles” the selected data set.  
Both the training and test data sets are read and merged together by row prior to the tidying (cleaning up) of the column labels/variables names for readability and saving as a CSV file.

Read_dataset

Receives 3 arguments consist of (a) a list of strings specifying the subdirectory and the data file, label file and subject information file, (b) a list of features to be selected (as strings) and (c) a list of activity names.  
A leader/header is created so that the full path can be used in the read.table calls.  
Three files are read in succession.  
The data file is read first, selecting only those features in the list of features (in this case those with mean and std in the name).  
The row label  and  subject identifier files are both read and “appended” as columns to the data frame.  
The last step is transforming the data frame into a data table before returning.
